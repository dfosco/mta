# MTA-CSS

A simple site with all NYC subway station signs. Built with React and exported to plain HTML with react-static (because you don't really need JS on the browser for this). Maybe I'll get an up-to-date list of stations from MTA's API (eventually).

Inspired by [The New York City Subway poster](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nycsubway/the-new-york-city-subway-468-stations-1-poster) and the (NYC Subway Graphics Standards Manual)[https://standardsmanual.com/products/nyctacompactedition] by Massimo Vignelli and Bob Noorda.

Hope you enjoy looking at this as much as I enjoyed making it. Dedicated to all my friends in NYC.
